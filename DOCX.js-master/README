Please use https://github.com/stephen-hardy/DOCX.js instead. 

DOCX.js is a document generator for Microsoft Word documents in Pure client-side JavaScript.

This is just a prototype. For consulting contact james@snapshotmedia.co.uk

I also made jsPDF back in 2009 - http://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF

Usage:

var doc = new DOCXjs();
doc.text('DOCX.js is a free open source library for generating Microsoft Word Documents using pure client-side JavaScript.');
doc.text('It was developed by James Hall at Snapshot Media.');
doc.output('datauri');

Output:

Nice shiny Microsoft Office Word Document.
